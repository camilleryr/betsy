The sander arrived in a timely manner and came in it's own molded plastic carrying case. After a few weeks of using the sander I find it to be very comfortable to use. Dust collection is adequate with the attached collection bag but I find using it with an external shop vac makes using it a virtually dust free operation. I would recommend using a smaller shop vac as attaching it to my large and much more powerful vac seemed to cause it to suck down to the board and inhibit the random orbit function. I use the sander two or three times a week in my home woodworking shop and find there is minimal vibration, a real change from my now retired my twenty five year old Craftsman sander. Hopefully this unit will last as long as the Craftsman did, time will tell. As for now I would recommend this as buy.","A.
